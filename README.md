# HTML-tweet

## Introduction
In this project, I created a clone of a tweet of Twitter using HTML and CSS. The clone is designed to resemble the original tweet as closely as possible, with the same layout and styling.

## Technologies Used

* HTML: Used to create the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Used to style the web page and make it look like the original tweet.

## Design Process
To create the Twitter clone, I first analyzed the structure and layout of the original tweet on Twitter. I then created the basic HTML structure of the tweet, including the header, body, and footer sections. Within the body section, I created separate elements for the user avatar, username, handle, tweet text, and any attached images or videos.

Next, I applied CSS styles to the HTML elements to match the styling of the original tweet. This involved setting the font family, font size, colors, and margins/padding to create the same visual layout.

## Result
The result is a clone of a tweet on Twitter. It has the same layout, styling, and content as the original tweet, making it an accurate representation of a tweet on the platform.
